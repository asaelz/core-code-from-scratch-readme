# Interpreted And Compiled Programming Languages
## first of all ==> what are they? 
### in short a compiled programming language required a program called *compiler* the fuction of a compiler is convert the whole code into machine languague or binary code. instead a interpreted language is not directly convert into machine language otherwise is executed line by line for an *interpreter*

#Advantages 
### Compiled
1. Compiled languages are faster because the *compiler* read the whole code and covert it into machine languague inside the same machine.
2. The code is secure because you only send a binary file (executable version of your code that only can be read for the machine)
### Interpreted
1. cross-platform, only interpreter needed 
2. less secure because if you need to send your program you send a copy of your code
3. Easy to test
